# Python Sets README

## Introduction to Sets in Python
In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Key characteristics of sets:
- Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
- Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.

## Creating a Set
```python
# Creating a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Creating an empty set
empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)  # Output: set()
```

## Adding Elements to a Set
```python
# Adding elements to a set
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Adding a duplicate element (no change in set)
my_set.add(3)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```

## Creating a Set from a List
```python
# Creating a set from a list (removes duplicates)
my_list = [2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6]
set_from_list = set(my_list)
print(set_from_list)  # Output: {2, 4, 6}
```

## Set Operations
### there are 2 ways of performing set operation

#### WAY 1
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Union of sets
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Intersection of sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}

# Difference between sets
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
```

#### WAY 2
Using symbols

##### Set Operations and Their Symbols
In Python, sets support several operations using built-in methods. Here are some common set operations along with their symbols:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Union (|): Combines elements from both sets, removing duplicates
union_set = set1 | set2
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Intersection (&): Returns elements common to both sets
intersection_set = set1 & set2
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}

# Difference (-): Returns elements in the first set but not in the second
difference_set = set1 - set2
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference (^): Returns elements present in either set, but not both
symmetric_difference_set = set1 ^ set2
print(symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}

# Subset and Superset (<=, >=): Checks if one set is a subset or superset of another
is_subset = set1 <= set2  # Subset check
is_superset = set1 >= set2  # Superset check
print(is_subset)  # Output: False
print(is_superset)  # Output: False
```

## Summary
- Sets are useful for storing unique elements and performing operations like union, intersection, and difference between sets.
- Remember, sets are unordered collections, so the order of elements is not guaranteed.
- Due to this you don't use Indexing for Set

This README provides a basic overview of sets in Python, including creation, manipulation, and common operations. Experiment with sets to explore their functionalities further.
